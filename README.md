# nth Root of Unity
This code will find the nth root of 1. Consider an equation x^5 = 1. This equatio has five total roots. One of them is 1. Others are complex numbers. This code will help the user to find all such roots, not for just X^5 but for any x^n, where n is a natural number. The user will have to enter a natural number, which will be n, and then the code will compute all roots.
